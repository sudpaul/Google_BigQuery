# Google BigQuery 

This repo is my workspace for developing and experimentation of Google BigQuery materials, IPython notebooks, and tutorials.

Google BigQuery is for analyzing and visualizing big data, implementing cloud-based big data solutions, deploying or migrating big data applications to the public cloud, implementing and maintaining large-scale data storage environments, and transforming/processing big data.

Installation and configuration
------


If you would like to run the Jupyter notebooks locally, (option 1. above), you'll need to install the following:

-  Jupyter is a requirement to view the ipynb files. It can be downloaded [here](http://jupyter.org/install.html) 
- Necessary packages are Pandas, NumPy,Matplotlib, seaborn.   
   -  For Linux/OSX users, you should not have a problem installing the above, [*except for Matplotlib on OSX*](http://www.penandpants.com/2012/02/24/install-python/).
   -  For Windows users, check out [pre-compiled versions](http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/) if you have difficulty. 

Prerequisites
------


- Google Cloud Platform Big Data
- Experience using a SQL-like query language to analyze data
- Knowledge of Python 

Thanks to Kaggle community for all the support all credits to the team to develpe the  Python package called bq_helper. It has some helper functions for getting data out of BigQuery that will simplify the process of getting data.
